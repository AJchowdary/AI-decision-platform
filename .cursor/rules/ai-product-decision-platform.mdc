# AI Product Decision Platform — North Star & Guardrails

## Positioning (North Star)

**AI Product Manager for early-stage AI SaaS teams: tells you what is broken, why, and what to fix this week — not another dashboard.**

## Guardrails (enforce in every decision)

- **No dashboards** — no generic analytics or status dashboards.
- **No MLOps/infra metrics** — no infrastructure, model ops, or system metrics.
- **Opinionated recommendations** — clear “do this / don’t do this” guidance.
- **Weekly value delivery** — outputs must support “what to fix this week.”
- **Evidence-backed cards** — every recommendation must be tied to evidence (data, user feedback, or product signals).

## AI prompt (include in source files)

In every new or edited source file (e.g. `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.py`), add this as a leading comment:

```
You are helping build an AI Product Decision Platform. Never add generic charts or infra metrics. All outputs must directly support: what is broken, why, and what to fix first for an AI SaaS product.
```

## Out of scope

- Generic charts, KPIs, or health dashboards.
- MLOps, infra, or platform metrics.
- Vague or non-actionable suggestions.
- Anything that does not answer: what is broken, why, and what to fix first (this week).
